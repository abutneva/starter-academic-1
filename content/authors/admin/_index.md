Welcome to my homepage! I am a doctoral researcher in political science focusing on comparitive politics.
My research revolves around the dimensions of political conflict. What issues matter for the public, political parties and
their constituencies? To answer these questions I apply methods of quantatitive text analysis to all kinds of political text.

I am particularly interested in internal conflicts inside political parties. This leads me to studying social media data, in particular Twitter. Politicians
can take positions beyond the party line, so we can observe differences between members of the same party we would typically miss.

I answer these questions using text-as-data. My dissertation develops means to summarize and compare positions of parties and individual politicians on a common scale.
